 
A bit about myself: My interested for computers started around the age of 7, when I was playing around with an Apple III. Intrigued by the capability of computers, I started to learn programming at the age of 10 years. I started with good old QBasic, Pascal, and finally arrived at C/C++ as well as a bit of Assembly. Naturally, I studied computer science to professionalize my early passion. I did my bachelor's at the University of Munich (LMU). I then switched to the Technical University of Munich (TUM) to do my Master's degree. At TUM, I learned about the great group of [Computer Aided Medical Procedures (CAMP)](http://campar.in.tum.de/WebHome) working on a diverse set of topics in a highly interdisciplinary fashion. Fascinated by the prospects of AI in healthcare, I decided to do my Ph.D. on issues at the intersection of medical imaging and machine learning (raw ultraound data processing for applications such as early detection of Parkinson's disease), advised by [Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab). After completing my Ph.D. I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, in the group of [Sandy Wells](https://lmi.med.harvard.edu/people/william-wells). At the same time, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, working with the group of [Polina Goland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/index.html). After my postdoc, I went back to Europe to conduct research in an industrial setting at SAP SE, Berlin.

Currently, I am Director of AI Research at SAP SE in [Berlin, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/52.5467648,13.4660096/SAP+MÃ¼nzstr+15/@52.5365216,13.4064717,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x47a851e1dab74057:0xae8d4cd859f4c58a!2m2!1d13.406999!2d52.5242668).

### Research

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Although not my current main focus, I am very much interested in machine learning in the medical domain and hope to pursue this further at some point.
Internship Position: Our research team is continuously hiring students and interns. If you're a Ph.D. student interested in a research internship working in Berlin, please send an email with your CV and research interests. Right now, we are particularly looking for interns for medical imaging (self-supervised learning), NLP (commonsense reasoning), and privacy-preserving ML. Check out our research team's [blog](https://medium.com/sap-machine-learning-research) to learn more about current research activity there.
